Nether Bits
by magico13

-- 0.3.3 --
 * Machines use a single block ID now. YOU MUST BREAK AND REPLACE THEM, OR YOU WILL LOSE THEM IN THE FUTURE!
 * Lava crystal resonators now have a smoother "filling" animation (13 total states)
 * Dungeon spawn frequency is configurable. Default is 2% chance (lowered from 5%)
 * Lava crystal resonator code cleaned significantly.
 * Cobble gen bug fix, it would always keep 1 cobble in it even if a redstone signal was applied
 * Resonance Band lasts half as long (I believe it's 5 minutes in lava/ 7.5 in fire)

-- 0.3.2 --
 * Update to MC 1.4.7
 * Resonator texture is now dependent on pairing. When paired, the lava texture faces the paired block.
 * Resonator texture is now animated. Has 4 stages, empty, low, mid, and full.
 * Internal file structure changes. Cleans up the structure a lot.
 * Cobble gen can be disabled with redstone
 * Cobble Gen no longer lets you put anything except cobblestone into the slot (before would throw it out)
 * Shards are now worth the same as lava buckets in a furnace. Reformed shards are worth 4x.
 * Added Nether Dungeons

-- v0.3.1 --
 * Update to Minecraft 1.4.6
 * Name changed from the generic Nether Ore Mod to Nether Bits
 * Lava Gen and Cobble Gen now use updateEntity() instead of block updates. Hopefully fixed occasional loss of pairing, and they should check for other unpaired resonators if they lose pairing.
 * Added debug option to config

-- v0.3.0 --
 * Update to Minecraft 1.4.5
 * Lava Crystals now spawn taller. They should be easier to collect now.
 * Fixed the Pick Block functionality with the ores.
 * Added Resonance Band. Crafted from three reformed crystals and iron. Prevents damage from fire for 15 minutes, or from lava for 10 minutes.
 * Slight change to Cobble Gen texture

-- v0.2.5 --
 * Changed recipe of Resonator to OOO, OCO, OOO where O is obsidian and C is a reformed crystal. Now only requires 1 diamond and 16 crystal shards
 * Added reformed crystal and reformed shard. Reformed shards are made from four crystal shards, reformed crystals are made from a diamond and 4 reformed shards.
 * Added additional debug info for myself.
 * Added config option for crystal generation rate.

 -- v0.2.4 --
 * Added Cobblestone Generator. Requires a shard, an iron pickaxe, a bucket of water, and a bunch of cobblestone. Produces 2 cobblestone a second. Can be pumped out from any side and ejects any items that aren't cobblestone.
 * Really (hopefully) fixed resonators being able to make triplet double spawners.
 * Rebalanced ore generation.
 * Reduced resonator time to 90 seconds.

 -- v0.2.3 --
 * Update to Forge 318 for 1.3.2
 * Changed crystal shard texture. Hopefully is nicer now.
 * Added ability to right-click with shard to spawn lava source block
 * Changed resonator recipe to require 6 obsidian and 3 crystals
 * Changed crystal recipe to require 8 shards surrounding a diamond
 * Complete Resonator rewrite. They are now tile entities and only work in a pair. Can't make triplet double spawners anymore, and theoretically shouldn't be able to trick it into generating twice.

 -- v0.2.2 --
 * Added config option for resonator frequency, value is in seconds
 * Changed default resonator update frequency from 30 seconds to 120 seconds
 * Resonators now schedule an update when placed in the world instead of waiting for a random tick. Should still survive sessions.
 * Added recipe to convert crystals into crystal shards.
 * Added attempted fix for residual lava flows causing issues with new sources being made.


 -- v0.2.1 --
 * Added lava crystals, generated in lava, drop lava crystal shards
 * Added lava crystal resonator. Crafted from crystals and obsidian like TNT. When placed two blocks away from each other, cause a lava source to spawn between them every 30 seconds, after initial wait. Occassional Null Pointer Exceptions noticed.
 * Fixed Nether Torch recipe creating only one torch
 * Added red flame to Nether Torch.
 * Fixed coal generating only below level 30
 * Changed coal textures to be lighter

 -- Pre v0.2.1 --
 * Added ores
 * Added ender ore
 * Nether coal acts as 1.5 coal for fuel and torch making
 * Fortune and EXP drops work, however are very generous.
